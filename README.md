# digital-recipe-book
all your recipes in one place!

# url
`to be updated`

# getting the code
Open a terminal and navigate to the (parent) folder where you want to save the code. Run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/SDEV220-Group-Six/digital-recipe-book.git`

Running the above command will create a new folder containing the project. Navigate to that folder: `cd digital-recipe-book`

# creating your branch
In order to not overwrite anything on the main branch, run the following command immediately after you cloned the project:
`git checkout -b branch-name`

# getting latest updates from main
It's possible that while you are working on your branch, changes have been done to main. It is a good idea to get those changes first, and only then push your own to github. To do this, run the following commands:
`git checkout your-branch` - make sure you are working on your branch
`git fetch origin` - fetch the latest changes from the remote repository. This updates your local information about the remote branches but does not change your working directory.
`git merge origin/main` - merge any changes from origin/main (the main branch on the remote) into your branch to make sure youâ€™re up-to-date. This allows you to test and address any conflicts locally before pushing your work. If there are any conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them.

# pushing your changes
After merging, if you had to resolve conflicts or added new changes, you may need to push your branch back to the remote repository:
`git push origin your-branch`

# info
use own branch/branches to make changes.

open pull requests with main branch in order to merge your changes.

everyone can and should do codereviews on all open pull requests and approve or decline them.

this is just a first draft. above workflow might need changes if we notice something isn't quite right.
